# Linked List

This is a task of the Embedded System Programming course.

This repo contains the implementation of Linked List written in C.

### the structure of Linked List is as follow:
```
struct linked_list{
  char *data;
  int index; /* position of the element in the list, normally not used with Linked Lists, just for exercise */
  struct linked_list *next;
};
```
#### The `master` branch currently contains basic functions which satisfly the following requirements:

#### The `additional` branch currently contains 4 more functions which satisfly the following requirements:

#### The *`bidir` branch modifies the structure of `struct linked_list` to be bidirectional and the functions to handle bidirectional situations.
